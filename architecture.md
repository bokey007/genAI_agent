🧩 1. Core Flow with Turn-Based Ticket Creation
Each conversation session tracks the number of turns (user + agent exchanges).

After each agent response, the system checks:

Was user feedback “satisfied” or “not satisfied”?

Has the unsatisfied-count reached the configured threshold (e.g. 5 turns)?

If unsatisfied-count ≥ threshold and user still not satisfied at that point, the agent invokes create_ticket.

Until threshold is reached, agent continues to attempt retrieval/reflection to answer.

User can still provide final feedback even after ticket creation; ticket is logged once per session.

2. Updated RAG + LangGraph + LangMem Architecture
LangGraph state includes:

turn_count

unsatisfied_count

ticket_created flag

Nodes:

generate (produce answer)

reflect (if needed for self-improvement)

feedback (parse user satisfaction and update counters)

Conditional controls:

Only enter ticket-creation tool when (unsatisfied_count >= threshold AND ticket_created == false).

Otherwise loop back into reflection/generation nodes, up until turn limit or satisfaction.

Reflection loops follow the LangGraph self-reflection pattern:

e.g. generate → reflect → evaluate, loop if reflection indicates improvement needed or feedback low score, up to max attempts (like 3 reflect passes)

LangMem records conversations and feedback in long‑term memory: facts such as repeated user dissatisfaction on certain topics, so future sessions avoid similar failures

3. Sample LangGraph Flow Logic
text
Copy
Edit
START → generate_node → reflect_node (optional) → respond to user → feedback_node
feedback_node:
  update turn_count += 1
  if (user_satisfied == false): unsatisfied_count += 1
  if (unsatisfied_count ≥ threshold AND ticket_created == false):
     call MCP tool create_ticket, set ticket_created=true
  if (turn_count < max_turns AND user_satisfied == false):
     loop back generate (perhaps with adjusted prompt)
  else:
     END
reflection_node uses prompt-based critique to improve answer if prior attempt unsatisfactory, up to max reflection attempts (e.g. 3)

Ticket creation triggers only once per session.

4. FastMCP Tool Updates
The create_ticket tool remains, but agent calling logic now gated by counters in LangGraph state. State ensures if ticket_created = false before tool invocation. Once ticket issued, agent may still answer but not re-create a ticket.

5. Feedback & Self‑Improvement Automation
User feedback (satisfied/not, comment) is logged along with turn metadata.

LangMem hot-path: stores user feedback as memory during conversation.

LangMem background consolidation: analyzes across sessions to extract patterns (e.g. topics with frequent dissatisfaction)

Reflection nodes adapt prompt behavior: e.g., retrieving broader context or adjusting query chunk-size if dissatisfaction persists.

Over time, the agent learns better retrieval strategies or prompt structures—all without fine-tuning.

6. Data Schema in Postgres
Table sessions: session_id, user_id, turn_count, unsatisfied_count, ticket_created_id

Table feedback: session_id, turn_number, satisfied_flag, comment, response_text

Table tickets: ticket_id, session_id, creation_time, status

Postgres also stores vector chunks via pgvector and embedding data.

7. Deployment Considerations
Session state and counters are maintained in LangGraph’s state store (Postgres-backed), persisted per session/thread.

The threshold parameter (default=5) is configurable via environment variable or Helm chart.

Monitoring tracks: average turns per session, ticket creation rate, satisfaction rates.

Logging includes when ticket creation triggered, to analyze if threshold is appropriate.

8. System Component Summary
Component	Role in Turn‑Threshold Logic
LangGraph state	Tracks turn_count, unsatisfied_count, ticket_created
Reflection nodes	Attempt to self-correct up to max reflections before next turn
Feedback node	Updates counts and checks threshold for ticket creation
FastMCP tool	Creates ticket only when invoked by agent logic
LangMem	Records feedback and patterns across sessions for self-improvement

✅ Summary
The agent only triggers ticket creation after a configurable number of unsatisfied turns.

Until that threshold is reached, it continues to self-reflect and reattempt responses.

Only a single ticket is created per session, even if user remains unsatisfied thereafter.

The full self-improvement loop is automatic, using LangMem + reflection, with no fine-tuning.

Stored counters, session data, and feedback in Postgres enable analytics and threshold adjustments over time.
